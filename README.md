## I'm Grant, a high school student in Dallas Texas that enjoys coding.

My favorite languages are
*    [C++](https://github.com/grantlemons?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c%2B%2B&sort=)
*    [Python](https://github.com/grantlemons?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=python&sort=)
*    and [Java](https://github.com/grantlemons?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=java&sort=)!

I'm probably most comfortable with C++ because of all the Arduino projects I've done, but if I was going to make a new project and I had the choice I'd probably default to Python.

I'd like to be more active on github but I don't have that many projects to work on / an busy with my schoolwork.
However, [my father](https://github.com/brentlemons) and I have a project to work on where we would hopefully [create our own drone using arduino](https://github.com/brentlemons/drone-telemetry)

I have a [VSCode Extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) that colors comments depending on suffixes\
Here is the key:\
```
//--------------------//
    * = Important
    ! = Warning
    ? = Question
    TODO = To Do
  //// = Strikethrough
