## I'm Grant, a high school student in Dallas, Texas that enjoys coding.

My favorite languages are:
*    [C++](https://github.com/grantlemons?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c%2B%2B&sort=)
*    [Python](https://github.com/grantlemons?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=python&sort=)
*    [Rust](https://github.com/grantlemons?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=rust&sort=)
*    and [Java](https://github.com/grantlemons?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=java&sort=)!

I'm currently learning Rust, which has been super fun and its system of borrowing has provided a challenging new way for me to approach problems.

I'd like to be more active on github but I don't have that many projects to work on / an busy with my schoolwork.
Currently the [main project](https://github.com/grantlemons/waterlevel) I'm working on is a combination IOT and Backend API project to measure and analyze the water level in my pool so it can be used in the future for a smart refilling solution.
