### I'm Grant, a high school student in Dallas Texas that enjoys coding.

My favorite languages are
*    [C++](https://github.com/grantlemons?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c%2B%2B&sort=)
*    [Python](https://github.com/grantlemons?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=python&sort=)
*    and [Java](https://github.com/grantlemons?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=java&sort=)!

I'm probably most comfortable with C++ because of all the Arduino projects I've done, but if I was going to make a new project and I had the choice I'd probably default to Python.
