## I'm Grant

I'm currently learning Rust, which has been super fun and its system of borrowing has provided a challenging new way for me to approach problems.

I'd like to be more active on github but I don't have that many projects to work on / an busy with my schoolwork.
Currently the [main project](https://github.com/grantlemons/waterlevel) I'm working on is a combination IOT and Backend API project to measure and analyze the water level in my pool so it can be used in the future for a smart refilling solution.
